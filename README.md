Why This Architecture is Professional
Single Source of Truth: All data lives in one place

Predictable Updates: Data flows in one direction

Easy Testing: Store logic is separate from UI

Performance: Only components using changed data re-render

Developer Experience: Easy to debug and understand data flow




Professional Architecture Flow:
tsconfig.json → Sets up TypeScript rules and path aliases

tailwind.config.js → Defines design system and styling

types/*.ts → Defines data structures and contracts

lib/utils.ts → Provides reusable helper functions

Components → Use all of the above for type-safe, styled, functional UI
